# redirect_maker
This was an example project as requested by [Wikipedia user RhinosF1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RhinosF1), prior to their indefinite blocking. This project was to demonstrate how to create [user space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_pages#Terminology_and_page_locations) [redirects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirect) for each month of the year to their [user page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RhinosF1).

This specific repository is ***largely unmaintained/abandoned***. No further work is planned.
